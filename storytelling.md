## Becoming Homo Techno

This is an anthropocentric story about our species. Home Sapiens.
Homo Sapiens had a dream to become immortal.
To preserve the vibrant being, protect him from the age-related cellular decline of vital physiological functions essential for survival and reproduction – aging.

**Pursuing immortality**

From the beginning of our physical presence, questions begin to arise about the non-physical one.
We have been preoccupied with the idea of eternal life ever since. Although the desire for physical immortality is yet unfulfilled, the desire to gain eternal life, however impossible it may seem, has been partially attained. 

Everything changed in the 19th century, in 1826, when the first photograph in history (then dated as heliography) was taken.
Since then people depicted in photographs have been spoken of in the present tense, even though they have been already a decade in the past.
The second level of human immortality began with the launch of the Internet on January 1, 1983, although it has been used since the 1960s by government forces. 
With the advent of the internet, and more specifically during the advent of social networking in the early 21st century, our physical identity has been enriched by its digital version. 

Human activity in physical space leaves a carbon footprint, whereas human activity in virtual space leaves a digital footprint. Just as the cells in our body are being renewed, our digital data - the digital cells of the human being – are being updated.  Are we part of the first generation that, after leaving our physical bodies, will be left to live in digital form?


**1 digital generation**

We are the first generation of people living at the interface of physical and digital environments. McLuhan's concept of the "global village" has come true. 
Human identity is now conditioned not only by the physical environment, but also by the virtual sphere, which we have incorporated once, and seemingly forever, into our everyday lives over the last 20 years.

In the digital age, humanity is undergoing a profound transformation. Our minds, shaped by constant interaction with electronics, are undergoing fundamental changes. Those who have grown up surrounded by technology are no longer merely Homo Sapiens; according to American artist and visionary Grimes, we can refer to a new type of human, Homo Techno. This evolution marks a significant shift in our species, where the fusion of biology and technology blurs the lines between human and machine.
While past technological advancements have undoubtedly shaped us, it is the integration of computers that truly defines Homo Techno. Through brain augmentation, our cognitive capacities are enhanced, leading us into a state of accelerated evolution.
Are we still Homo Sapiens, bound by the limitations of biology, or have we transcended into Homo Techno, beings whose essence is intertwined with technology? This question forces us to reconsider our identity and the trajectory of our species as we navigate to the frontier of human-machine integration.

French philosopher Bruno Latour addressed the question of the intersection of the sphere of nature with the sphere of technology and culture, deconstructing the boundary between them.  According to Godfrey Reggio, the American director of symbolistic, socially orientated films, it is impossible to separate the two spheres as well. According to him, we live not with technology, but in technology. 
Are we approaching the predictions of Aldous Huxley's anti-utopian novel? 
This phenomenon confirms also the global statistical data platform, Statista, which found out that during the last year, 2023, an average human spent 6 hours and 40 minutes a day online. That fact represents almost half of a person's waking hours during the day, which, in broader terms, points towards spending half of one's life online.


**Digital body, digital consciousness**

Today, thanks to the influence of more advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, we have new opportunities to explore the idea of immortality in another, non-physical realm.
Could AI technologies redefine our understanding of human existence and longevity?

The digital sphere represents a seemingly greater freedom of expression than the physical one.
In the digital environment, we are becoming curators of our personality.
A person's physical identity is inevitably tied to the human body, human shell, which at the same time represents its limitation.
Nowadays, there is a coexistence of physical (Citizen) and virtual (Netizen) entities.  According to Baudrillard, we live in a cyber realm of hyper reality, a real environment without the origin of reality, in which the principle of simulation prevails.  A simulation of real life, we can be part of on platforms such as Second Life or Metaverse, in which it is possible to build a virtual life using a personalized avatar.

In addition to the possibilities regarding the prolongation of human physical existence provided by effective medical devices, one of the most exciting aspects of artificial intelligence is the possibility of preserving human consciousness through neuro informatics.
Despite the technological capabilities available today, none of them have been developed to fulfill the complex entity of virtual reality, to create a digital copy of the human mind.
By uploading our thoughts, memories and consciousness into a digital substrate, we could potentially achieve a form of immortality in which our essence remains capable of existence and communication with the terrestrial world, as reflected in the 4th episode of San Junipero in the British science fiction series Black Mirror, dealing with the fate of modern society as a result of new technologies.

The arrival of a new medium is always accompanied by a fear of the unknown.
Marschall McLuhan argues that the new medium is always only the content of its media predecessor.  After all, the identity crisis described in the literary works of Aldous Huxley or Luigi Pirandello seems to be based on the same fears as the one we have today, even though it was experienced by people living a hundred years ago. Technologies change, principles remain.


**Am I**

Fascinated by this phenomena, my personal work, a digital collage series, *Am I*, explores the intersection of virtual and physical human identity, at the intersection of virtual and physical space. The title *Am I* consists of an abbreviation for artificial intelligence,"AI", and the question of self-affirmation, "Am I?", which reflects the identity crisis of the human being of today.

The first generation of people whose footprint will remain after leaving their physical shell in digital form is now present in the world. The following becomes the subject of consideration. Is there a meeting point between our physical and virtual reality?

The story takes place at the imaginary interface between the physical and the digital, in the environment of purgatory - purgatory, which, based on Christian tradition, is strongly associated with the transition to the realms of the afterlife, the transition between the material and immaterial world.
It is said that in the course of seven years our body undergoes a complete renewal of cells. The symbol of renewal, of a foundation that endures, is represented by the motive of the egg, which is depicted in the context of the present time.
The depicted clouds of the environment symbolize a virtual iCloud, to signify the eternal repository of our data, our digital cells.
The main character of the collage is a pregnant being, a being who is not defined by specific features.
It is an unearthly being who represents the essence of man, the collective consciousness of the whole. The figure represents the Hermaphrodite, a being that possess ability to impregnate itself. Entity able to regenerate itself over and over again representing a birth of a new type of human being capable of regenerating its physical and digital shell, physical cells and digital data.

*Am I*, a new type of man capable of eternal return ?
