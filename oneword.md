# One Word

**Mirr0r**

In the beginning, there was a chaos.
A chaos in its highest perfection. A chaos that created the reality we live in.
There are a lot of ways how to perceive reality.
Some people see the world as an unpredictable ball rolling down from the hill, not knowing at what point it hits you.
Some people, tend to perceive the events of life as an arranged line with a clear destiny.
When it comes to me, I like to observe the reality around me with the help of mirrors.

One day in August 2018, I happend to be on a road trip around Skandinavia, when suddenly I end up in the hospital somewhere in Bergen. The last thing I would expect was to meet a random stranger whom I had a weirdly strong connection with.
After minutes of talking about life, he told me how he perceives the world.
"IÂ´m your mirror. And you are mine.", he said and after our conversation this was the sentance that changed the way I was perceiving my reality.

A reality where every single element that happens, happens for a reason - to give me a lesson about myself.
