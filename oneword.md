# One Word

**Mirr0r**

At the beginning, there was a chaos.
A chaos in its highest perfection. A chaos that created reality we live in.
There are a lot of way how to perceive the reality.
Some people see the world as an unpredictible ball rolling down from the hill, not knowing at what point it hits you.
Some people, tend to perceive the events of life as arranged line with clear destiny.
When it comes to me, I like to observe the reality around me with a help of the mirrors.

One day in august 2018, I happend to be on a roadtrip around Skandinavia, when suddenly I end up in the hospital somewhere in Bergen. The last thing I would expect was to meet a random stranger that I had a weirdly strong connection with.
After the minutes of talking about life, he told me how he perceives the world.
"IÂ´m your mirror. And you are mine.", he said and after our conversation this was the sentance that changed the way I was perceiving my reality.

Reality where every single element that happends, happends for a reason - to give me a lesson about myself.
