The fascination for reflecting on the world around me has been strongly present in my daily life since my first memory. 

Being born as one of the first generations of post-soviet satellite country with a strong catolic tradition, I found myself fascinated by the legacy of norms, censoreship, uniformity and constructed mind beliefs and behavioral pattern, I appeared to be a part of. The ultimate fascination by what brings us to blindly follow our legacy, when the world seems to be so much more complex and diverse.

By questioning social behavioral and beliefs norms later in my life, I developed a visual language with which I was able to express the perspectives on social human patterns - a digital collage.

Collage happend to work as a reflection, as an artistic medium that embodies the concept of human perception of seemingly homogeneous reality from multiple perspectives. By adding a movement to the collage, i started to create collage animation videos.

In my work, I prefer asking questions more than finding answers...
