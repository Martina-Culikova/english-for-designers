# Year in Review

Throughout this year, I've noticed a repetitive pattern in my response to the general question of "How´s everything?“.
My constant answer has been: "Intensive."

To me, "Intensive" is a neutral term, embodying both positive and negative energy, reflecting our personal perception.
The way I picture an intensive year is a year full of dynamic moments, “ups and downs”, facing obstacles, finding time for self-reflection, establishing priorities, focusing on personal and professional growth, enjoying the presence of life, keep going, letting go, well.. 
one big sinusoid of embracing the full spectrum of life.




Overall, gratitude for my current circumstances, got me to better understanding of what all the “negative events” that were appearing in my life previous year actually meant.
For instance, signing a tricky apartment contract, taking jobs/projects I didn’t feel alight with, or being afraid of presenting myself (my personal work) authentically, got me into ( a period of intense stress, leading to health issues) to the significant reflections that thought me valuable lessons.
I learned that decisions made out of fear break my connection not only with myself, but with my inner voice trying to guide me. 
It´s worth the lesson we can take from it. It´s a reminder for trusting my inner voice, take action, and actually finish something.




I've noticed a tendency of mine, to navigate through life without acknowledging the impact of experiences on my mindset and character. Thankfully, my personal calendar serves as a reminder of my growth and evolution over time.
A year ago, I moved to a calm place where I currently live and made a decision to stay focused on my personal projects. Since then, my life has taken a turn for the better. I've regained love for what I do.
One profound realization I've had is that saying "no" to external pressures is saying "yes" to myself.
I've come to the understanding that an endless contemplation without taking action only leads to an inner frustration.
As well as endless seeking for perfection, that is never going to happen (in my eyes) and leads me only to stagnation. Therefore, I´ve been practicing discipline and letting myself to focus on enjoying the process. While it may take me some time to get into that state of mind, once I'm immersed in that process, I find myself in a state of flow.




Spending most of the time alone got me the opportunity to reflect, learn, and reconnect with myself. It doesn´t mean that this transition would be that idyllic. During the past year I lost connection with many friends I used to have. But despite the inevitable shifts in my social circle, I've found the support of my loved ones and the fulfillment from pursuing my passions. This led me to appreciate the importance of surrounding myself with individuals who share similar vision.


This year has been so far challenging in the best way possible. Being “trapped” in this sinusoid of changes, focusing on our inner flow and cherishing what we already possess resonates deeply with the path I wish to pursue.
