# Thesis Lightning Talk

The bachelor thesis, Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Humankind, presents
an insight into the realm of the identity of collage as an artistic medium that embodies
the principle of human perception, of a seemingly homogeneous reality, by combining disparate elements into a new context.  
The aim of this thesis is to analyze the ability of collage to reflect the context of the society
in the time in which it is created, whether in terms of technical or conceptual aspects.
The theoretical part of the thesis examines the principle of perception of reality and compares it with the principle of collage creating, based on its chronological development over time.
In the practical part of the work, the author analyses aspects of contemporary identity 
of the society, at the interface of physical and digital environment, human and artificial intelligence. Author uses elements of photography, graphics and symbols of the digital environment, which she shapes into multi-layered messages. These elements, fragments, 
are then merged into a series of digital collages that, both technically and conceptually, reflects the author's reflection of the contemporary society.
