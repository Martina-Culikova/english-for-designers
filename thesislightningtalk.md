## Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Humankind

### Abstract

The bachelor thesis, Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Humankind, presents
an insight into the realm of the identity of collage as an artistic medium that embodies
the principle of human perception, of a seemingly homogeneous reality, by combining disparate elements into a new context.  
The aim of this thesis is to analyze the ability of collage to reflect the context of the society
in the time in which it is created, whether in terms of technical or conceptual aspects.
The theoretical part of the thesis examines the principle of perception of reality and compares it with the principle of collage creating, based on its chronological development over time.
The practical part of the work presents analysis of the aspects of contemporary identity of society we live in, at the interface of physical and digital environment, human and artificial intelligence. I use elements of photography, graphics and symbols of the digital environment, which is than shaped into multi-layered messages. These elements, fragments, are then merged into a series of digital collages that, both technically and conceptually, reflects a personal reflection of contemporary society.

### Thesis

The bachelor thesis, Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Humankind, explores collage as an artistic medium in terms of its relationship towards the society in which it is created.
The choice of the main motive of the thesis, reflects my personal fascination of the human perception of reality. The way in which we create meaning of seemingly random events happening in our life, whether on a personal or collective level.
Collage (fr. coller - to glue) is an artistic medium that combines these elements into a coherent form. Each single fragment carries its own meaning. The creation of their interconnection may reflect, re-interpret, or even challenge the human understanding. Therefore, the creation of a collage can be compared to the formation of a new perspective on reality.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the ability of collage to reflect the context of the society in the time in which it is created. In my thesis I am trying to ask questions about the identity and the role of collage.
What aspects determine the very identity of collage?
What function does collage represent in a changing time and society?
Is there a difference between physical, digital, or AI collage?
How is the process of creating a collage connected to the creation of a new view of reality?
Are there any limits to it?

###  Theoretical part

Interpretation of the selected topic includes an analysis of the collage phenomenon in terms of its definition, the mirroring principle and technological development over time.
The theoretical part is divided into two chapters: Collage as a Reflection, which presents an insight into the sphere of the identity of collage in relation to the society of a certain period of time; and Fragments of Reality, which explores the way in which the human mind constructs its perception of reality.
The theoretical foundations of the subject are rooted in the history of visual art and philosophy, using the symbolism of the socio-cultural context, as well as knowledge from the field of neuroscience. I use available professional sources, publications, or my own testimony.

### Practical part

The content of the practical part of the bachelor's thesis is created in relation to the above description of the theoretical part.
The focus of the thesis is on the aspects of contemporary identity of the society, which moves at the interface of the physical and digital spheres.
The thesis is a reflection on the ongoing cycle of cellular and data renewal of the human aspect. The work results in a series of seven digital collages, called  Am I, containing symbolic meaning. The name Am I consists of an abbreviation for artificial intelligence "AI" and the self-affirmation question, "Am I?".

#### Am I

The series observe fragments of reality of contemporary times, times when human life is able to regenerate itself both in a physical and digital sphere.

From the beginning of our physical presence, questions arise about the non-physical. We are the first generation of people whose footprint will remain in digital form after leaving our physical shell. This leads to a crucial consideration: Is there a meeting point between our physical and virtual reality?

The plot of the series unfolds at the imaginary interface between the physical and the digital, within the environment of purgatory. This concept, rooted in christian tradition, is strongly associated with the transition to the afterlife, melting the borders between material and immaterial.
It is said that over the course of seven years, our body undergoes a complete renewal of cells.
The symbol of renewal is represented by the motive of the egg, conceived in the context of the present time. The depicted clouds in the environment symbolize a virtual iCloud, rappresenting the eternal repository of our data, our digital cells.
The main character of the collage is a pregnant figure, not defined by specific features. This unearthly being represents the essence of humanity, the collective consciousness of the whole. The creature embodies Hermaphrodite, a biparental being capable of self-renewal. This symbolizes the birth of a new type of human, capable of regenerating both physical and digital aspects â€” physical cells and digital data.

A new human capable of eternal return.

Have we reached immortality?

### Installation

The series is installed in a horizontal line, making the observers feel as they were part of a never-ending space of collage.
