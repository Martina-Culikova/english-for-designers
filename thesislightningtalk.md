# Thesis Lightning Talk

### Abstract

The bachelor thesis, Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Humankind, presents
an insight into the realm of the identity of collage as an artistic medium that embodies
the principle of human perception, of a seemingly homogeneous reality, by combining disparate elements into a new context.  
The aim of this thesis is to analyze the ability of collage to reflect the context of the society
in the time in which it is created, whether in terms of technical or conceptual aspects.
The theoretical part of the thesis examines the principle of perception of reality and compares it with the principle of collage creating, based on its chronological development over time.
In the practical part of the work, the author analyses aspects of contemporary identity 
of the society, at the interface of physical and digital environment, human and artificial intelligence. Author uses elements of photography, graphics and symbols of the digital environment, which she shapes into multi-layered messages. These elements, fragments, 
are then merged into a series of digital collages that, both technically and conceptually, reflects the author's reflection of the contemporary society.


### Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Society

The bachelor thesis, Fragments of Reality: Collage as a Reflection of Society, explores collage as an artistic medium in terms of its relationship to the society in which it is created.
The choice of the main motive of the thesis, reflects my personal fascination of the human perception of reality. The way in which we make meaning, whether on a personal or collective level, of seemingly random fragments happening in our life.
Collage (fr. coller - to glue) is an artistic medium that combines this cluster of elements into a coherent form. Each single fragment of reality carries its own meaning. The creation of their interconnection reflects, re-interprets, or even challenges the human understanding of reality. Therefore, the creation of a collage can be likened to the formation of a new perspective on reality.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the ability of collage to reflect the context of the society in the time in which it is created. In my thesis I am trying to ask questions about the identity and role of collage.
What aspects determine the very identity of collage?
What function does collage represent in a changing time and society?
Is there a difference between physical, digital, or AI collage?
How is the process of creating a collage connected to the creation of a new view of reality?
Are there any limits to it?

**Theoretical part**

Interpretation of the selected topic includes an analysis of the phenomenon of collage in terms of its definition, the principle of mirroring society, and technological development over time.

The theoretical part is divided into two chapters: collage as a reflection of society, which presents an insight into the sphere of the identity of collage in relation to the society of a certain period of time; and Fragments of Reality, which explores the way in which the human mind constructs its perception of reality.

The theoretical foundations of the subject are rooted in the history of visual art and the schools of thought in philosophy, using the expressive means and symbolism of the socio-cultural context of the time, as well as knowledge from the field of neuroscience. The information is drawn through available professional sources, publications, or authors' testimonies.

**Practical part**

The content of the practical part of the bachelor's thesis is created in relation to the above description of the theoretical part. The focus of the thesis is on the aspects of contemporary identity of the society, which moves at the interface of the physical and digital spheres. The thesis is a reflection on the ongoing cycle of cellular and data renewal of the human aspect.


**Am I ?**
The work results in a series of seven digital collages, containing symbolistic meaning. The series called Am I reflect on the fragments of the reality of contemporary times.The name Am I  consists of an abbreviation for artificial intelligence "AI" and the self-affirmation question, "Am I?".
