# Voice, Tone and Style

## Voice

**Harmonic** 

I enjoy surrounding myself with individuals whose voices resonate harmoniously with me. I hope I am able to reciprocate the same effect for them. Creating a peaceful atmosphere and transmitting positive energy are qualities I deeply value.


**Mindful**

Being alone for most of the time during the day, I cherish opportunities to engage with others in meaningful conversations about visions, ideas, and realizations, whether in a serious or absurd manner. I tend to be conscious with my words and insights that I share, or just opting for silence.


**Curios and understanding**

Every individual possesses unique knowledge and experiences that I lack, and each of them has gone through challenges I may never face. I tend to listen more than talk, using questions to build trust and understanding in my interactions. Through these connections, I gain insight into the world from the perspective of others, seeing it through the eyes of a stranger.

## Tone

**Calm**

I speak with a lower-pitched voice, using a tranquil tone, focusing on transmitting positive energy. My voice is at a moderate volume - not too soft, yet not overly loud - reflecting confidence through tranquility.


**Empathetic**

Using my voice not only to express my point of view, but also to actively listen and truly understand what the other person has to say. Listening to different perspectives is enriching. People we interract with, are something like sources of guidance or mirrors reflecting our perception.


**Assertive**

I highly value open conversations baased on empathy and mutual understanding. This drives me to communicate clearly, avoiding passive-aggressive tone or people-pleasing behavior. I strive to be honest - but kind - aiming for transparency and clarity in my message delivery.

## Style

**Informal**

I prefer using small letters, even at the beginning of a sentence, to maintain a visually clean text. That is probably a reason I avoid diacritics and often incorporate keyboard symbols like parentheses, dots, and commas. My writing style varies depending on the phase i'm currently in.


**Visual**

I tend to prioritize the visual side of the text. Enriching it with visual elements and symbols, like emoticons, that add a new dimension to our verbal expression and can vary depending on the mood or context.


**Authentic**

I like to view writing as a means of expressing our thoughts, a reflection of both our conscious and subconscious mind. Therefore, I am drawn to texts that posses these features. One of my absolutely favourite is captivating writing of Zadie Smith. Her expressions are reflected by the form of the text, breaking the rules of formal and general text editing.
