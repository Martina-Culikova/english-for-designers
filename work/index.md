# Artwork

Based on my studies in both linguistics and visual arts, my artistic language rapresents observation and reflection of human reality, finding a comprehension in the spectrum of human perspectives developing within the context of the Anthropocene. 

The essence of my work lies in finding connections between human concepts and visuals and forming them into the different interpretation. The main aim is not only to reflect on the past but most importantly to reflect on those patterns using the digital visual language of contemporary times.

To bridge the conceptual with the visual, I discovered that digital collage is the most expressive medium that transforms the observation into a reflectionâ€”an artistic medium encapsulating the diverse human perceptions of what seems to be a homogeneous reality, viewed through the kaleidoscope of multiple perspectives of the layers of collective consciousness. 

By adding a movement to the collage, i started to create collage animation videos to gain the freedom to tell stories.
